## About Me

I am a highly self-motivated individual with a passion for computer security, boasting a robust foundation in cybersecurity and a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Engineering. With over 4 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in areas such as web application security, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and mobile application security for iOS and Android platforms.

My expertise extends to both black-box and white-box security testing methodologies, enabling me to conduct thorough security assessments on web applications, APIs, enterprise, and engineering applications. I am well-versed in dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools like Burp Suite Professional, Qualys, and Traceable, as well as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools such as GitHub Advanced Security and Mobile Security Framework (MobSF).

I have a keen understanding of web security principles, techniques, and technologies, utilizing a diverse range of penetration testing tools. My hands-on experience includes executing attack vectors from the OWASP Top 10 and working with various open-source security tools, including proxies and fuzzers.

Actively engaging in security-specific conferences, webinars, and Capture The Flag (CTF) contests, I stay abreast of the latest developments in the field. Strong in documentation, I excel in delivering thorough penetration test reports. My skills and knowledge equip me to tackle complex security challenges with a creative and out-of-the-box thinking approach.
